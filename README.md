# Seasonal Sales

> This app does the following

* Uses Javascript to pull from 2 separate JSON files and compiles them into Arrays
* These arrays are then used to establish the products that will print to the page, as well as the discount that will be applied to each product once the corresponding seasonal discount has been selected from the dropdown.
* Once the season and it's discount has been selected from the dropdown, the corresponding discount will then be applied to the items within that season.

> This will allow you to freely use the drop down to select any season and apply the corresponding discount for that season to the relevant items.
